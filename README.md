About project
This is the HackGirls project for the ALU internal hackathon 2019. 

This app helps in water conservation by raising awareness on the inpotance of water conservation and teaching users how to conserve water. Research shows that by using less water, we don't need to treat and pump so much water, therefore less money is spent on energy, chemicals and on additional reservoirs or boreholes.Reducing the amount of energy used in the pumping of water will reduce carbon emissions, which contributes to greenhouse gases, and leads to climate change.Reducing waste in our home or business means that we reduce the amount of water that has to be treated or that uses energy unnecessarily. Water that goes straight down the drain without being properly used is a waste and is costly to you, the environment and us.

LiquiDot has the following features listed below to help in water conservation in Africa.

I) It raises awareness on the importance of water conservation.
II) It teaches users practicals ways of conservaing water at home and the community through daily tips on how to conserve water
III) it provides a platform for users to report water leakages in their community to water authorities who are responsible for fixing the issues, 
IV)it connect users with plumbers within their community incase they have leakages in their homes and need services.
V) it collects water usage date from users and a user can choose to give weekly, daily, or monthly data by taking a survey.Based on the data gotten from the survey we advice on how they can improve conservation and the data can be used by policy makers as well.
VI) It sends users notifications on days that it will rain so that they can prepare to collect rain water for reservation
